WHAT I HAVE DONE

(1) I've put everything into the one working directory (haven't actually
done this for born_zeros yet but I will soon)

(2) The Pythia6 code compiles, but doesn't work on my analysis.
I need to redo the analysis, probably looking at the code from ttbar_NLO
and maybe trijet for examples

(3) For some reason Pythia8 won't even compile on my mac, but it does on
the desktop. Therefore I've got 2 options, either write an analysis on the computer
that works, or comment out anything that uses boost2reson4, write it on my 
laptop, and then see if it works on the computer.

(1) Have got the two codes to compile, and can do some analyses.
Have taken some of the code from ttb_NLO_dec to get it running,
including boost2reson4 etc. Also, the subroutines are slightly different
between this analysis and the top one from hvq, hvq is only set up to for
semileptonically decaying tops where as the one in ttb_NLO_dec is for
dileptonically decaying tops.

(2) The analysis works for pythia8, however, in pythia6 the b mesons are 
unstable and so it doesn't find the b jets correctly. Need to turn this off
and see if we get similar results.

(3) Comparing the lhef analysis with the pythia ones, it is not clear that
the code is correctly identifying the b jets. Getting the code to output
the n hardest jets and then identifying when they are b-jets, I would have
assumed the b jets to have a similar pT to the bare b quarks, however, this
is not always the case, I will have to look into this further.
